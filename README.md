An modern and easy to use method to implement Single Image Dehazing.  
[![Open Source Love svg1](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)


## Key Features
- Capable removing haze from both indoor and outdoor images.
- Unlike traditional methods, it is much more quick and easier to use.
- Added a code snippet to also calculate the PSNR ratios of the new and old images.


## ðŸ”” Running the code
1. Save the image/dataset you want to use in the same folder as the code. <br>
`Not that the image name(s) should be numbers preferably starting from 1`
2. Open the code in your matlab environment and run the code 
3.  The new dehazed image should be saved in the same directory ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## TODO :boom: ?
- [X] Merge the PSNR script to main script
- [X] Be able to read all image formats without explicitly asking.
